GitHub repository for building AXIS java object from BIG-IP WSDLs

Requirements:

This is tested on linux machines with the following packages 
installed an in the executatble path:

maven2
wget

and have Internet access to the maven public repositories.


Instructions:

Step 1.  Edit the pom.xml file setting the properties to your BIG-IP.  
This will enable the build to login to your and download your version
of the iControl WSDLs. 

You need to edit the following three properties starting on line 11.

  <properties>
    <bigip>192.168.200.145</bigip>
    <bigipusername>admin</bigipusername>
    <bigippassword>admin</bigippassword>
  </properties>

You can test your values by opening a web browser to:

https://[bigip]/iControl/iControlPortal.cgi

and when prompted for basic credentials use the [bigipusername] and [bigippassword]
you put in the pom.xml file. The build script will attempt to fetch the 
WSDL files from your BIG-IP each time you run it. The actual git script objects are
less than 50kB (basically size of a jpeg on a web page) so you can keep different 
version of the iControl jar for each version of BIG-IP you code against.

Step 2. Use maven to build AXIS java objects and optionally install them

To build you can issue:

	mvn package

If you are only working with one version of the iControl object (or just the latest!)
you can also install the jar file into your local maven repository

	mvn install

Note: 

If the credentials to get to the BIG-IP or wrong or the BIG-IP can not be reached, 
the build process will do very little and build an empty jar file.  No WSDLs = no 
java objects!

You will see the build script first get the WSDLs and then build each.  If you 
do not see this, then it had problems getting to your BIG-IP to get the WSDLs.

Enjoy!
